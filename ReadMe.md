The project developed here has two folders.

One with the noisy images - noisy_data.

And another one containing the images processed by the algorithm - denoised_data.

The algorithm is present in the Filter.ipynb file, it has 4 cells, which are necessary to execute to generate the results.

The algorithm was developed with Python 3.7.9 and OpenCV 3.4.2
